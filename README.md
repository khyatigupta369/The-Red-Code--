World around, women face the most disadvantageous situation while talking about "menstrual health and hygiene". It is considered taboo in society and this is not only the case in India but all around the world.

##Inspiration

Being a team where we all are female members it was easy for us to imagine the problems faced by women during these days but though we learned about a lot of shocking details while working on this project like 23 million girls drop out of school due to menstrual problems. So we wish to sensitize people around us and help females by providing them better reach of menstrual products and doctors for consultation along with various services.
We built our website by mainly using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap
